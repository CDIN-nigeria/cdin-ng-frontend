            PROMOTING DIGITAL ECONOMY THROUGH CRYPTOGRAPHIC ASSURANCE.
            </span>
        CDIN is an NGO and a platform
        for bringing together stakeholders in Nigeria to work on a common interest of addressing gaps
        in cryptography related developments including crypto-currencies and crypto-ransomwares. Lack of
        Awareness and Stakeholders collaboration are the two major gaps we have identified for now.
        Identified stakeholders includes institutions in the following sectors: Education, Defense, Economy
        and Technology. Our Strategic Themes are: Platforms, R&D and Collaboration. Our platform initiatives
        includes Weekly Meetups, Monthly Podcasts, and Annual Conference.
